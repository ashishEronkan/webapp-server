So we avoid using\n * animation-delay and instead set custom keyframes for each color (as redundant as it\n * seems).\n *\n * We write out each animation in full (instead of separating animation-name,\n * animation-duration, etc.) because under the polyfill, Safari does not recognize those\n * specific properties properly, treats them as -webkit-animation, and overrides the\n * other animation rules.
